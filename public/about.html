            <h2>Welcome to Your Spirit Animal Discovery Journey</h2>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Our quiz uses advanced AI technology to create a personalized experience for each visitor.

            <h2>The Science Behind the Magic</h2>
            <p>While our quiz is designed for entertainment, it's built on the principle that our current mood and energy can be reflected in animal archetypes. Each animal represents different qualities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wise Animals</strong> (Owls, Elephants) - Represent contemplation and inner wisdom</li>
                <li><strong>Energetic Animals</strong> (Dolphins, Hummingbirds) - Embody joy and high energy</li>
                <li><strong>Grounded Animals</strong> (Bears, Turtles) - Symbolize stability and patience</li>
                <li><strong>Adventurous Animals</strong> (Eagles, Wolves) - Reflect freedom and exploration</li>
            </ul>
